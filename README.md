# proposition

This code is abandoned.

This library handles propositions, logical formulae consisting of literals without quantification. It automatically simplifies a proposition as it is constructed using simple rules provided by the programmer. Implementations of propositions in terms of an abstract syntax tree and as a Binary Decision Diagram (BDD) are provided. A standard interface is provided for all propositions.
